## 🧠 Why AWS for Umbraco?

| Benefit                    | Why It Matters                            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Fully managed .NET hosting | Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, App Runner        |
| Cloud SQL (RDS) support    | Connect to SQL Server on RDS              |
| Scale on demand            | Auto Scaling with Beanstalk or ECS        |
| Secure & production-ready  | IAM, SSL, VPC, ALB support                |
| CI/CD friendly             | GitHub Actions, CodePipeline integrations |

## ✅ Option 1: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (.NET)

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Umbraco app published using `dotnet publish`
- `web.config` in place (for IIS hosting)
- RDS SQL Server instance ready

### 🏗️ Step-by-Step

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
```

Create a `.zip` of your publish folder.

#### 1. Go to AWS Console → Elastic Beanstalk

- Create New Application
- Platform: **.NET on Windows Server**
- Upload `.zip` file

#### 2. Configure RDS SQL Server

- Use **Amazon RDS** to create a SQL Server instance
- Add connection string in `web.config`:

```xml
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="umbracoDbDSN" connectionString="Server=mydb.rds.amazonaws.com;Database=UmbracoDb;User Id=admin;Password=yourPassword;" />
</connectionStrings>
```

#### 3. Open site URL

Elastic Beanstalk will give you a public endpoint like:

```ini
http://your-env.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

## 🐳 Option 2: AWS ECS (Fargate) with Docker

### 💡 Why ECS?

- Runs containerized workloads (from your Docker image)
- Uses AWS Fargate = **No need to manage EC2**

### 🛠️ Setup Steps

1. **Push Docker image to Amazon ECR**

   ```bash
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name umbraco-app
   docker tag myapp:latest [account_id].dkr.ecr.[region].amazonaws.com/umbraco-app
   docker push [account_id].dkr.ecr.[region].amazonaws.com/umbraco-app
   ```

2. **Use ECS Fargate Task Definition**

   - Define a task with:

     - Your Docker image from ECR
     - Environment variable: connection string to RDS
     - Mount `/umbraco/Data` if needed with EFS

3. **Create ECS Service**

   - Use Application Load Balancer (ALB) to expose the service
   - Auto-scale on memory or CPU

4. **Use RDS for SQL Server**

   - Same as Beanstalk setup — ensure it’s in the same VPC

## 🤖 Automate Deployment with GitHub Actions

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to AWS ECS

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Login to Amazon ECR
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

      - name: Build and Push Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t umbraco-app .
          docker tag umbraco-app:latest ${{ secrets.ECR_URI }}
          docker push ${{ secrets.ECR_URI }}

      - name: Deploy to ECS
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
        with:
          task-definition: ecs-task-def.json
          service: umbraco-service
          cluster: umbraco-cluster
          wait-for-service-stability: true

## 🔐 Security Checklist

| Task                   | Tool                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Store passwords safely | AWS Secrets Manager             |
| Restrict RDS access    | Use security group for ECS only |
| Use HTTPS              | ALB + ACM (free certs)          |
| Secure S3 or EFS data  | Enable encryption at rest       |
| Monitor usage & logs   | CloudWatch                      |

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

| Problem                     | Fix                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 500 Error after deploy      | Check logs in Elastic Beanstalk / ECS task logs |
| Cannot connect to database  | Check RDS SG, VPC, or wrong conn string         |
| Docker image not found      | Make sure ECR URI and auth are correct          |
| App stuck in initialization | Umbraco needs write access to `/umbraco/Data/`  |
