# 🔐 Member vs User Authentication

> Understand the difference between **Users** and **Members** in Umbraco, when to use each, and how to build login-protected areas for site visitors 🧠🛡️

---

## 🤔 What’s the Difference?

| Feature       | **User**                               | **Member**                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Who?          | Backoffice users (editors/admins/devs) | Public site users (customers, members)    |
| Access        | `/umbraco` dashboard                   | Frontend website                          |
| Auth Location | Login via `/umbraco`                   | Login via Razor or API                    |
| Role System   | Granular section permissions           | Groups + role-based protection            |
| Use Case      | Content editors, devs, admins          | Members-only pages, subscriptions, forums |

✅ For frontend **logins and protected pages**, you'll use **Members**.

## 🧠 Common Use Cases for Members

| Scenario                      | Use Member?   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| 📰 Newsletter subscribers     | ✅ Yes        |
| 💬 Forum participants         | ✅ Yes        |
| 📚 Online course students     | ✅ Yes        |
| 🎯 Admin editing content      | ❌ (Use User) |
| 🧾 Clients accessing invoices | ✅ Yes        |

## 🧱 Step-by-Step: Member Login System in Razor

---

### 🧰 Step 1: Create Member Type

> Backoffice → **Members** → Member Types → ➕ New Member Type

Name: `RegisteredUser`

✔️ Add properties like:

- `email` (TextString)
- `firstName` (TextString)
- `isActive` (True/False)

📌 Important:

- Check ✅ “Is an Umbraco Login Member”
- Set `email` as Login field

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create Registration SurfaceController

📁 `Controllers/RegisterSurfaceController.cs`

```csharp
public class RegisterSurfaceController : SurfaceController
{
    private readonly IMemberManager _memberManager;
    private readonly IMemberService _memberService;

    public RegisterSurfaceController(
        IMemberManager memberManager,
        IMemberService memberService,
        ...base params...
    ) : base(...) {
        _memberManager = memberManager;
        _memberService = memberService;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Submit(string email, string password)
    {
        if (await _memberManager.ExistsAsync(email))
        {
            TempData["Error"] = "Member already exists.";
            return RedirectToCurrentUmbracoPage();
        }

        var member = _memberService.CreateMember(email, email, email, "RegisteredUser");
        _memberService.SavePassword(member, password);

        await _memberManager.SignInAsync(HttpContext, email);

        return RedirectToCurrentUmbracoPage();
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Razor Form for Signup

In `Views/Register.cshtml`:

```cshtml
@using (Html.BeginUmbracoForm("Submit", "RegisterSurface"))
{
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" required />
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required />
    <button type="submit">Register</button>
}
```

---

### 🧠 Step 4: Login Form + Logic

📁 `Controllers/LoginSurfaceController.cs`

```csharp
public class LoginSurfaceController : SurfaceController
{
    private readonly IMemberManager _memberManager;

    public LoginSurfaceController(IMemberManager memberManager, ...) : base(...)
    {
        _memberManager = memberManager;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Login(string email, string password)
    {
        var result = await _memberManager.PasswordSignInAsync(HttpContext, email, password, true);

        if (result.Succeeded)
            return RedirectToCurrentUmbracoPage();

        TempData["Error"] = "Invalid login";
        return RedirectToCurrentUmbracoPage();
    }
}
```

---

### 📝 Razor Login Form

```cshtml
@using (Html.BeginUmbracoForm("Login", "LoginSurface"))
{
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" required />
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required />
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
}
```

---

## 🔒 Step 5: Protect a Page from Anonymous Visitors

> In Backoffice → **Content → Right-click page → Public Access**

Choose:

- 🔐 Role based protection
- ✅ Member group: `RegisteredUsers`

Umbraco will prompt:

- **Login page** → Set to a login form
- **Error page** → Set to "No access" message

Only logged-in members can view the page now! 🔐🎉

---

## 🙋‍♂️ Bonus: Check If a Member Is Logged In

In Razor:

```cshtml
@if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated && Member != null)
{
    <p>Welcome @Member.Name!</p>
}
```

---

## 🔚 Logout Action

```html
<form method="post" action="/umbraco/Surface/Member/Logout">
  <button type="submit">Logout</button>
</form>
```

Or programmatically:

```csharp
await _memberManager.SignOutAsync(HttpContext);
```

## ✅ Summary

| Concept      | Member (Frontend)     | User (Backoffice)        |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Login Area   | Site (form)           | `/umbraco`               |
| Auth Service | `IMemberManager`      | `IBackOfficeUserManager` |
| Protection   | Public Access         | Permissions/Groups       |
| Common Use   | Registered site users | Admins, editors          |
