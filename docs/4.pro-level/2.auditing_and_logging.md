## 🧠 Why Auditing & Logging Matter

Effective auditing and logging in Umbraco help you:

- 🕵️‍♂️ Track who changed what and when
- 🔐 Detect unauthorized or suspicious activities
- 📜 Maintain compliance with regulations like GDPR
- 🛠️ Debug issues efficiently with detailed logs

## 🔍 Built-in Audit Trail

Umbraco provides an **Audit Trail** feature that logs actions such as content edits, publishes, deletions, and user logins.

### 📄 Viewing the Audit Trail

To access the audit trail for a specific content node:

1. Navigate to the **Content** section.
2. Select the desired content node.
3. Click on the **Info** tab.
4. Review the **History** section to see actions performed, by whom, and when.&#x20;

## 🗃️ Understanding Umbraco's Logging System

Umbraco utilizes **Serilog** for structured logging, outputting logs in JSON format for better readability and analysis.

### 📁 Log File Location

By default, logs are stored in:

```ini
/umbraco/Logs/UmbracoTraceLog.{MachineName}.{Date}.json
```

### 🛠️ Customizing Logging Settings

You can configure logging settings in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"Umbraco": {
  "CMS": {
    "Logging": {
      "MaxLogAge": "2.00:00:00", // Retain logs for 2 days
      "Directory": "~/CustomLogFileLocation" // Custom log directory
    }
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to control log retention and storage location.&#x20;

## 🧰 Implementing Custom Logging

To log custom events or information, inject the `ILogger<T>` interface into your classes:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class MyService
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyService> _logger;

    public MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void DoWork(string taskName)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Executing task: {TaskName}", taskName);
    }
}
```

This approach ensures structured logging, making it easier to filter and analyze logs.&#x20;

## 🧪 Best Practices for Auditing and Logging

- **Regularly Monitor Logs**: Set up alerts for critical events like failed login attempts or unauthorized access.
- **Secure Log Files**: Ensure that log files are stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel.
- **Implement Log Rotation**: Prevent log files from consuming excessive disk space by configuring log rotation policies.
- **Audit Member Activities**: For member login tracking, implement custom logging in your authentication logic, as Umbraco doesn't log member activities by default.&#x20;
